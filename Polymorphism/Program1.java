	============= Java Language =============

	Polymorphism :

 	* Polymorphism is derived from two Greek Words,"Poly" and "morph",which means 'many' and 'forms'
	  respectively.Hence,Polymorphism meaning in Java refers to the ability of Objects to take
	  on many Forms.
	* Types of Polymorphism :

	  1)Compile Time Binding (Method Overloading).
	  	* The Methods with the same name can have different numbers of parameters,different
		  types of Parameters or different orders of Parameters in Method.

	  2)Run Time Binding(Method Overriding).
	  	* It is a type of runtime polymorphism where the method in the subclass overrides
		  the method in the superclass,which has the same "name,parameters and Return Type"
		* Here the method to be called is based on the instance of the subclass,which is assign
		  to a reference variable of the superclass.
		Note : Compulsory Required the Parent-Child Relation.
